# Exoself

## Overview

This is an Android app that I wrote a while back. It serves as an interactive task list, allowing users to complete one task at a time in a linear manner. The main purpose is to motivate a person to just get started by enabling them to focus on a single task at a time.

## Inspiration

I mainly take inspiration from the book "Mind Performance Hacks" [1] and its accompanying Wiki [2], which contains a compilation of productivity tips and ideas. One of these ideas is ”Build an Exoself,” in which flashcards with singular tasks written on them, in conjunction with a periodic timer (e.g., a phone alarm), are used to increase one’s productivity.

I was drawn to this idea because of the sci-fi concept of programming yourself. For instance, the list of tasks can be viewed as a stack, with the task cards acting as instructions for oneself. The periodic timer functions as an interrupt signal, which alerts the user to take action--whether it involves executing the instruction, postponing it, repeating it, disregarding it, or voiding it altogether.

Ultimately, the aim is to alleviate the anxiety of deciding what to do next and to encourage users to just make progress on their tasks.
